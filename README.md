## What to contirbute?
- Any projects you have done in the past for academic purposes
- Include readme or project report explaning the project
- Include the entire working code

## How to contribute? 
- Fork the reposirtory and add a folder of your project 
- The folder must have a relevant name
- Open a pull request for the same 

### Adhere to the rules for easy merging of the pull requests. Happy Hacking!

For non-code contributions, documentation related to projects is welcome. 
Folders without a ReadMe or any kind of report should be targeted for the same. Ideal
for contributors not from a coding background!
